## Project Workflow
Excelling - Really great planning docs and fleshed out readme!

## Technical Requirements
Excelling - Nice job incorporating AWS and google maps api. Canvas drawing is super cool! And it all persists with a backend. To top it all of very marginal instructor support, you figured this out pretty much on your own!

## Code Quality
Performing/Excelling - Code is nicely formatted. I would encourage you to provide some more comments for your application though!

## Creativity Interface
Excelling - User interface is pretty seamless and the site is beautiful! Very cool idea, I hope you get to your icebox!
